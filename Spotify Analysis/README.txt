The principal goal of this Spotify project is to import a real-life data set, work with the data, and perform basic exploratory data analysis; all while using Tableau produce an TWBX file that is fully reproducible and RapidMiner to use ML models create additional graphs. I had selected Spotify Dataset and worked on demonstrating several skills as a part of my Applied Analytics coursework at Stevens Institute of Technology. These include collaborating with:1. Many data types (numerics, characters, dates, etc)2. Features that are not normalized (may contain punctuations, upper and lowercase letters, etc)3. Data sets that must be combined4. Unclean information (missing values, values that do not align to the data dictionary)5. Variables that must be generated (i.e. the data may contain income and expense variables but you want to analyze savings such that you need to create a 6. Savings variable out of the income and expense variables)7. Data that should be filteredI selected following CSV file from Tom Mock: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md#spotify_songscsvDuring this Analysis I have provided with a report that contains Introduction, Data Preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis and Summary section.
